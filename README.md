# FtpController
<p>Statement created to show the functionality of using ftp to control the upload of files, ensuring when it finishes uploading if the files actually arrived on the other server, this was done to meet the need of a company that wanted to guarantee the transfer of images.</p>
<p>We use this form of transfer because the project requested the use of ftp.</p>
